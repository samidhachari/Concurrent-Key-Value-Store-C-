# Concurrent-Key-Value-Store-C++
Developed a concurrent key-value store in C++ to explore fundamental concepts of data storage and retrieval in multi-threaded environments.
Implemented an LRU caching mechanism to improve read performance and file persistence to ensure data durability.
Leveraged TBB for efficient handling of concurrent requests, addressing challenges related to data consistency and thread synchronization. This project demonstrates an understanding of building scalable and reliable data storage systems.
